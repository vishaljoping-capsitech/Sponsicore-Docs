                A temporary ID is issued to guests for identification and access control within the premises. This ensures that guest movement is monitored and secure. Access can be restricted based on biometric device settingsâ€”meaning guests can be granted entry only to specific areas they are authorized for. For example, if a guest is permitted to access only certain sections of the office, biometric controls will automatically deny them entry to restricted zones, enhancing both security and operational control.
