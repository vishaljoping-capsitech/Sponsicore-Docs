To help users tailor the view to their needs, a variety of filters are available, allowing customization based on different criteria such as attendance status, department, or shift timings. Additionally, the status indicators themselves serve a dual purposeâ€”when clicked, they act as quick filters, instantly refining the employee list to show only those matching the selected attendance status. This interactive design makes it easy to analyze attendance data efficiently and focus on specific groups or trends with minimal effort." />
