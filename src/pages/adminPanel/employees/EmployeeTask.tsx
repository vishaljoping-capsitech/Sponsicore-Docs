            The user can view employee-related tasks. If a task has not been
            added by the employee, the user can send a notification and email to
            the employee. We also display the employee's status for that
            dayâ€”such as Present, Absent, Week Off, Holiday, etc. We also display
            the total due tasks for the selected month. We've added a filter to
            view customized data.
