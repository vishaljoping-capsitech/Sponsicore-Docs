                  The Email Section in Sponsicore allows users to manage all
                  organization-related communications in one place. Users can
                  view, compose, and manage both drafted and sent emails with
                  ease.
                  <li>
                    At the core of the Email Section is a comprehensive table
                    that displays all email records. Each entry provides
                    essential information to help users track and manage their
                    messages efficiently.

                    To help locate emails easily, the system provides filter and
                    search functionality. Quickly filter emails based on their
                    current status â€” Draft or Sent. Use the search bar to find
                    emails by subject, sender name, or other key details. This
                    makes it simple to manage large volumes of email records
                    efficiently.

                    email using the Compose button located at the top-left
                    corner of the table. This opens the email composer
                    interface, designed for clarity and flexibility.
