To make navigation intuitive, requests are categorized by their type and displayed as clickable bricks. These bricks not only provide a clear visual summary of each request category but also serve as filtersâ€”allowing users to quickly select and view requests belonging to a specific type. This approach enhances usability by simplifying the process of tracking, reviewing, and responding to different kinds of employee requests efficiently." />
