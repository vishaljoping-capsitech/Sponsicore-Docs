These include updates to personal details (like address or bank information), permissions for client meetings, work from home or client site, attendance corrections, missing card entries, unauthorized absences, and other custom requests. The interface displays requests from the past 10 days along with all upcoming ones, with filters available for quick sorting. Each request type appears as an interactive brick that doubles as a filter, with a red dot indicating pending actions. Authorized users can approve or reject requests using the status buttonâ€”once actioned, the request becomes view-only. An automated email is also sent to the employee, confirming the admin's decision and maintaining clear communication." />
