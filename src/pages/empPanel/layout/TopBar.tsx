                <Title text="User Information: " />
                Displays the name of the currently logged-in employee.

                <ul>
                  <li> Shows the employeeâ€™s attendance status for the day, such as Present, Absent, Work from Home (WFH), Work from Client (WFC), Leave, Holiday, or Weekend Off. </li>
                  <li> A pending icon may appear beside the status to indicate that a WFH or WFC request is awaiting approval. </li>
